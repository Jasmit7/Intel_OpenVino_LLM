# Mistral-7B Logical Reasoning AI

## Project Overview

This project leverages the Mistral-7B Large Language Model (LLM) to create an AI system capable of answering complex logical reasoning questions. By fine-tuning the model on the Open-Platypus dataset, we've developed a powerful tool that aims to match and potentially surpass human capabilities in logical problem-solving.

## Features

- Advanced logical reasoning capabilities
- Trained on a diverse dataset of ~25,000 entries
- Ability to tackle complex problems previously limited to human cognition
- Rapid and accurate responses to challenging queries

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Open-Platypus dataset, which consists of approximately 25,000 high-quality data entries specifically curated for logical reasoning tasks.

## Model Architecture

This project is based on the Mistral-7B LLM, a state-of-the-art language model known for its efficiency and performance. Key architectural features include:

- Grouped-Query Attention
- Sliding-Window Attention
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```
pip install transformers trl accelerate torch bitsandbytes peft datasets -qU
```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("mosaicml/instruct-v3")
```

2. Format the dataset:
```python
def create_prompt(sample):
    # [Include the create_prompt function here]
```

3. Load the Mistral 7B base model:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch

# [Include the model loading code here]
```

4. Generate responses:
```python
def generate_response(prompt, model):
    # [Include the generate_response function here]
```

## Fine-tuning Process

1. Prepare the model for 4-bit LoRA training:
```python
from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM, LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training

# [Include the PEFT configuration code here]
```

2. Set up training arguments:
```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

# [Include the TrainingArguments setup here]
```

3. Train the model:
```python
from trl import SFTTrainer

# [Include the SFTTrainer setup and training code here]
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the test split of the dataset. Evaluation is performed every 20 steps during training.

## Limitations

- The current implementation uses a subset of the full dataset for training.
- Performance may vary depending on the specific logical reasoning tasks.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the model's performance or expand its capabilities. Please submit pull requests or open issues to discuss potential enhancements.
